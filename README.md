# Game Scoring Analysis

## Objective
Analyze and evaluate different scoring systems for a multiplayer social game
to understand balance, fairness, and player incentives.

## Context
The game is a turn-based social game with:
- Multiple players
- One or more impostors
- Voting mechanics
- Point rewards and penalties

Players can:
- Vote to eliminate impostors
- Gain or lose points based on their decisions
- Play multiple rounds per match

## Key Questions
- Are the current scoring rules fair?
- Do they incentivize correct voting or random behavior?
- How does the number of players affect balance?
- Does rewarding impostor survival make the game unfair?

## Methodology
- Define scoring rules and assumptions
- Simulate game outcomes using Monte Carlo methods
- Analyze distributions of scores and outcomes
- Compare different scoring configurations

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Project Status
Work in progress.
